# Data-Scraping
We will scrap the data from Men's Shoes Section from https://matchesfashion.com  website.
Firstly we imported some important libraries such as beautifulsoup and requests then we used beautifulsoup to parse the Html data.
Then we extracted the Name, Brand, Price, Product URL and Image URL for our 1st Product, then we scraped the information of all the products available on the first page and created a Data Frame by using Pandas Library.
Then we collected URL's of all the webpages of MathesFashion website and similarly scraped all the data of the matchesfashion.com from men's shoes section.
